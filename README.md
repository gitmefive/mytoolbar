# mytoolbar
Wow,this is my first formal project posted on github,I'm a newcomer in Font-end engineering,
I'm inexperienced,but also invite more attention,lol.

## about this project
This item shows a toolbar used in webpage,offering the function of backing to the top of a webpage.
THe toolbar includes three icons,the first one is a icon of github,when you click the icon,the webpage
will turn into my homepage of github,the second one is a icon of my blog,and the last is the back-to-top button.

Though the project is very easy,it uses the requirejs,jquery,scss.It's a good exercise for me.
